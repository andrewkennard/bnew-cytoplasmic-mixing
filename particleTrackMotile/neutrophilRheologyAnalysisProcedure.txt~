The following describes the procedure for getting and analyzing data on rheology within motile cells:

1) Obtain lysotracker-labelled images, saved as tiff stacks.
(Talk to Caleb about detailed procedure)
It is assumed that all the data for a single movie of a single cell is saved in one directory that contains a metadata file and several sequential tiff stacks (labelled *Cell#*.ome.tif, *Cell#*_1.ome.tif, *Cell#*_2.ome.tif, etc., where # is some index number for that movie).

2) Get the analysis code from the git server
Refer to the git-primer on how to do this
You will need the following repositories:

/Users/git/repositories/BNEW.git
(code for performing BNEW analysis on a set of trajectories, to get effective diffusion coefficient, scaling, etc.)

/Users/git/repositories/particleTrackMotile.git
(code for processing image stacks, tracking particles, etc.)

3)
